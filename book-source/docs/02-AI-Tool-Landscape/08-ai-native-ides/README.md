# Chapter 8: AI-Native IDEs - Zed, Cursor, Antigravity, and the Future of Development

**Part 2: AI Tool Landscape** | **Proficiency Level**: A2-B1 | **Duration**: 6-8 hours

## Overview

This chapter introduces modern development environments designed from the ground up for AI collaboration. You'll explore three distinct approaches to AI-native IDEs: **Zed** (performance-focused), **Cursor** (VS Code evolution), and **Antigravity** (agent control plane architecture).

**Important**: This chapter teaches you to **observe and evaluate AI-generated code**, not to write code manually. You'll prompt AI systems and critically analyze their outputs—building skills essential for AI-assisted development.

## Learning Path

### 8-Lesson Sequential Deep-Dive

1. **[AI-Native Concepts](lessons/01-ai-native-concepts/README.md)** (45-60 min)
   - What makes an IDE "AI-native"?
   - Architectural differences from traditional editors
   - The 2025 landscape overview

2. **[Installing Zed IDE](lessons/02-installing-zed/README.md)** (60-90 min)
   - Platform-specific installation (macOS, Linux, Windows)
   - AI provider authentication
   - Verification and first prompt

3. **[Zed AI Features & Workflows](lessons/03-zed-ai-features/README.md)** (75-90 min)
   - Inline assistant, multi-model configuration
   - Tab autocomplete, git integration
   - Mini-project: Temperature converter via Zed

4. **[Installing Cursor IDE](lessons/04-installing-cursor/README.md)** (60-75 min)
   - Installation and VS Code migration
   - Setup and verification
   - First comparison with Zed

5. **[Cursor AI Features & Workflows](lessons/05-cursor-ai-features/README.md)** (75-90 min)
   - Chat mode, Agent mode, .cursorrules
   - Diff-based change review
   - Mini-project: Temperature converter via Cursor

6. **[Installing Antigravity IDE](lessons/06-installing-antigravity/README.md)** (60-75 min)
   - Installation and agent architecture intro
   - Three surfaces: Agent Manager, Editor, Browser
   - First agent creation

7. **[Antigravity Agent Architecture & Features](lessons/07-antigravity-agent-features/README.md)** (75-90 min)
   - Artifact system, agent workflows
   - Context-aware editing
   - Mini-project: Temperature converter via Antigravity

8. **[Comparative Capstone: "Try With AI"](lessons/08-comparative-capstone/README.md)** (90-120 min)
   - Selection criteria framework
   - Observational comparison across all 3 IDEs
   - 1500-2000 word structured analysis

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, you should have completed:
- **Chapter 5**: Claude Code (natural language AI collaboration)
- **Chapter 7**: Bash Essentials (command-line proficiency)
- Optional: **Chapter 6**: Gemini CLI (comparative AI tool experience)

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

1. **Explain** the architectural distinction between AI-native IDEs and traditional editors with plugins
2. **Install and configure** at least one AI-native IDE (Zed, Cursor, or Antigravity) on your system
3. **Guide AI** to complete coding tasks using natural language prompts across multiple IDEs
4. **Apply selection criteria** (performance, features, collaboration, ecosystem) to choose appropriate IDEs for different projects
5. **Compare AI-native IDEs** through hands-on observation, documenting workflow differences
6. **Critically evaluate** AI-generated code for correctness, security, and quality
