# Chapter 14: Data Types

**Learning with AI as Your Partner**

In Chapter 13, you learned what Python is and ran your first Hello World program using `print()`. Now it's time to learn how to **store data in variables** and understand **what types are and why they matter**.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you will:

- Create variables with type hints to store different kinds of data
- Understand what a data type is and why Python uses them
- Work with core types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, and `None`
- Explore collections (list, tuple, dict, set) at awareness level
- Build an interactive type explorer demonstrating all concepts

## AI-Native Learning Approach

This chapter teaches data types through **AI partnership**, not syntax memorization:

- **Describe intent**: Type hints describe what data means (`age: int` = "age is a number")
- **Explore with AI**: Ask AI "what can I do with this type?" instead of reading documentation
- **Validate together**: Use `isinstance()` and `type()` to check understanding
- **Learn from errors**: When `TypeError` occurs, ask AI "why?" to deepen learning

## Chapter Structure

### [Lesson 1: Variables and Type Hints](01-variables-and-type-hints.md)

Learn to store data in variables with type hints, building on Chapter 13's Hello World knowledge.

**Duration**: 45 minutes
**Skills**: Understanding Variables (A2), Writing Type Hints (A2), Describing Intent (B1)

### [Lesson 2: Understanding Data Types - Integers and Floats](02-integers-and-floats.md)

Understand the type concept and explore numeric types (int, float) through AI dialogue.

**Duration**: 50 minutes
**Skills**: Data Type Concept (A2), Numeric Types (A2), Type Inspection (A2-B1)

### [Lesson 3: Strings and Booleans - Text and Truth](03-strings-and-booleans.md)

Learn text basics (str), boolean logic (bool), None, and type conversion.

**Duration**: 50 minutes
**Skills**: String Basics (A2), Boolean Logic (A2-B1), Type Conversion (B1)

### [Lesson 4: Introduction to Collections - Overview Only](04-collections-awareness.md)

Gain awareness of collections (list, tuple, dict, set) - comprehensive coverage in Chapters 18-19.

**Duration**: 40 minutes
**Skills**: Collection Awareness (A1-A2)

### [Lesson 5: Building a Type Explorer - Hands-On Practice](05-type-explorer-capstone.md)

Build an interactive type explorer applying all core type concepts (capstone project).

**Duration**: 50 minutes
**Skills**: Integration (B1), Type Validation (B1), AI-Guided Improvement (B1)

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, you should have completed:

- **Chapters 1-4**: AI-Native development mindset (Nine Pillars, AI as learning partner)
- **Chapters 5-11**: AI tool literacy (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, prompting, context engineering)
- **Chapter 12**: Python UV package manager (installation and environment setup)
- **Chapter 13**: Introduction to Python (What is Python + Installing Python + Hello World)

## What's Next

After completing this chapter, you'll be ready for:

- **Chapter 15**: Operators, Keywords, and Variables (what you DO with types)
- **Chapter 16**: Strings and Type Casting (string methods and formatting)
- **Chapter 17**: Control Flow and Loops (if/else, while, for)
