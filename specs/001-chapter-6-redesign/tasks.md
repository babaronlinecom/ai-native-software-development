# Tasks: Chapter 6 Redesign - Gemini CLI Installation and Basics

**Feature**: `001-chapter-6-redesign`
**Input**: Design documents from `specs/001-chapter-6-redesign/`
**Prerequisites**: spec.md (approved), plan.md (approved), constitution.md (v6.0.0)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by implementation phase and user story (learning objective) to enable systematic content development with pedagogical validation at each checkpoint.

**Policy Note for Lesson Authors**: Within this chapter, each lesson must end with a single final section titled "Try With AI" (no "Key Takeaways" or "What's Next"). Since AI tools were already taught in Chapter 5, instruct learners to use their preferred AI companion tool (Gemini CLI or Claude CLI), optionally providing CLI and web variants.

---

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story (learning objective) this task serves (US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately after plan approval
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion (needs terminal logs, citations ready)
- **Refactor (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational completion (Lessons 1, 2, 4, 5 provide context for 3, 7)
- **Three Roles + Capstone (Phase 4)**: Depends on Refactor completion (L8 references L7 skill creation)
- **Validation (Phase 5)**: Depends on all content implementation (Phases 2-4)
- **Meta-Learning (Phase 6)**: Depends on validation results

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1 - Tool Selection)**: Foundational for all other stories, teaches decision framework
  - Lessons: L1 (foundation), L2 (installation), L3 (error analysis), L4 (context), L5 (config)
- **User Story 2 (P2 - Three Roles)**: Depends on US1 completion (needs basic Gemini familiarity)
  - Lessons: L6 (Three Roles framework)
- **User Story 3 (P3 - Intelligence Design)**: Depends on US1, US2 (needs collaboration experience)
  - Lessons: L7 (reusable skills)
- **User Story 4 (P4 - Capstone)**: Depends on US1, US2, US3 (composes all prior knowledge)
  - Lessons: L8 (extension development)

### Within Each Phase

- Setup: All tasks T001-T013 can run in parallel except T012-T013 (depend on logs from T005-T011)
- Foundational: Each lesson is independent, all 4 can proceed in parallel
- Refactor: L3 and L7 can proceed in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Three Roles + Capstone: L6 must complete before L8 (capstone references Three Roles pattern)
- Validation: All validation tasks can run in parallel except T138 (depends on T122-T137)

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**:
```bash
# Launch research tasks in parallel:
Task T001: Context7 @google/gemini-cli research
Task T002: Google AI Studio docs verification
Task T003: GitHub repo docs verification

# Launch command testing in parallel:
Task T006: Test Google Search tool
Task T007: Test file operations tool
Task T008: Test shell integration
Task T009: Test web fetch tool
```

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**:
```bash
# Launch all 4 lesson enhancements in parallel:
Task T014-T021: Lesson 1 metadata addition
Task T022-T032: Lesson 2 metadata + shell example
Task T033-T041: Lesson 4 metadata + decision framework
Task T042-T050: Lesson 5 metadata + security
```

**Phase 3 (Refactor)**:
```bash
# Launch both refactors in parallel:
Task T051-T064: Lesson 3 error analysis restructure
Task T065-T079: Lesson 7 intelligence design restructure
```

**Phase 5 (Validation)**:
```bash
# Launch validation agents in parallel:
Task T122: validation-auditor (pedagogical review)
Task T123: factual-verifier (citation accuracy)
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 - Tool Selection Framework)

**Goal**: Deliver core value first - students can choose right AI tool for their task

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (research, command testing, logs captured)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (L1, L2, L4, L5 with metadata)
3. Complete Phase 3: Lesson 3 refactor (error analysis modality)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test error analysis exercise with target audience
5. Assess: Can students discover tool capabilities through productive failure?

**Deliverable**: Students understand tool selection framework and can apply to real scenarios (SC-001, SC-002)

### Incremental Delivery (Add Each User Story Sequentially)

1. **Foundation**: Setup + Foundational → Manual foundation complete (Stage 1)
2. **+ US1**: Add Lesson 3 error analysis → Tool selection framework complete (test SC-001, SC-002, SC-008)
3. **+ US2**: Add Lesson 6 Three Roles → Collaboration mastery (test SC-003, SC-013)
4. **+ US3**: Add Lesson 7 Intelligence Design → Reusable skills creation (test SC-004)
5. **+ US4**: Add Lesson 8 Capstone → Extension development (test SC-007, SC-011)

**Each increment is independently testable and delivers measurable learning outcomes**

### Full Chapter Delivery (All User Stories)

**Timeline**: 44-55 hours (1-1.5 weeks at 8h/day per plan.md estimate)

**Sequence**:
1. Phase 1: Setup (5-10 hours) - Research + command testing
2. Phase 2: Foundational (12-15 hours) - L1, L2, L4, L5 metadata
3. Phase 3: Refactor (14-18 hours) - L3, L7 new modalities
4. Phase 4: Three Roles + Capstone (18-22 hours) - L6 major refactor, L8 creation
5. Phase 5: Validation (8-12 hours) - Constitutional compliance checks
6. Phase 6: Meta-Learning (2-3 hours) - PHR documentation

**Total**: 59-80 hours actual (plan estimated 44-55, adjust expectations upward due to validation rigor)

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files or independent research, can run in parallel
- **[Story] label** maps task to user story for traceability (US1, US2, US3, US4)
- **Terminal logs required** for ALL command examples (Principle 3: factual accuracy)
- **Citations required** for ALL Gemini features (Context7 or official Google docs)
- **Metadata 100% complete** = CEFR + Bloom's + DigComp on every learning objective
- **Error analysis modality** (L3) must show productive failure → discovery pattern
- **Three Roles framework** (L6) must demonstrate all 3 roles explicitly, not just mentioned
- **Intelligence accumulation** (L7 → L8) must show skill creation → capstone composition
- **Capstone scope** (L8) must adhere to A2 tier guardrails (no database, no auth, 45-60 min)
- **Constitutional compliance** validated in Phase 5 before considering complete

**Avoid**:
- Vague tasks without file paths
- Hallucinated Gemini CLI commands (verify everything against research)
- Skipping metadata fields (100% completeness required)
- Implementing L8 before L7 (violates intelligence accumulation principle)
- Exceeding A2 cognitive load (≤7 concepts per section)

---

**Status**: Tasks ready for implementation. Proceed with Phase 1 Setup after approval.
